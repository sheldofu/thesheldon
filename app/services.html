                        <h4>Hello.</h4>
                        <p>Hello! Considering you're reading this, you're either a potential employer, or a stalker. Either way, I'll try and save you some time by answering some common questions you might have about me.</p>
                        <h4>What's your deal? What do you do?</h4>
                        <p>I am a <span class="violet">freelance front-end developer</span> with <span class="violet">two and a half years</span> experience, and have been a general developer including other fields such as business intelligence for a total of around 7 years.</p>

                        <h4>Are you any good? What does a usual day of work involve?</h4>
                        <p>I'm an advanced user of Javascript (Object Orientated Concepts/Protoypal Inheritance/Closures etc) and presented a knowledge share at a previous workplace, 'Common JS mistakes + best practices'. Day to day I'll usually be using some combination of Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 + CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, build tools such as grunt or gulp, and then push it all to git.</p> 

                        <h4>Fair enough, but I want someone who does more than get through the day. Are you a hobby programmer?</h4>
                        <p>Demanding, aren't you? In my own time I do like to keep up to date with the cooler things in Javascript you might not get to use on a daily basis. As you can see on my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, I've toyed with libraries and frameworks such as Phaser.js, a speech recongition API, skeleton, spotify app development, and more.</p>

                        <h4>Not bad, but that's all so 2014. What are you up to at the moment?</h4>
                        <p>Bit rude. I've just finished the book 'Write Modern Web Apps with the MEAN Stack' which has led me to writing node APIs that in conjunction with MongoDB and Angular form a simple CMS, giving friends and family control over their own content updates. I'm extremely interested in node and want to really master it, so I'll be concentrating my spare time on that.</p>

                        <h4>Have you got any other hobbies, for instance doing stand up comedy on an occasional basis, possibly entering and not making it through the first round of 'New comedian of the year'?</h4>
